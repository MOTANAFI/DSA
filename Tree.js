// TREE
// A DS is a fundamental hierarchical data structure.
// it represents a collection of elements (data) called nodes, connected by edges (links)
//forming a tree-like structure

// PERFECT TEE
// Full + balance
//BALANCE: All the leaf nodes are the same depth (distance from root).
// This means the tree is completely filled with no gaps at any level.


// COMPLETE TREE

// Almost Full levels: All levels except possibly the last one are 
// compleletly filled with nodes. 
// Left Leaning Last Level: The last level is filled with nodes
// from the left side as much as possible. 
//There might be empty spaces on the right.
