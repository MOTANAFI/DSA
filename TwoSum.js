// Two sum
// imaging you have a list of numbers and a target number.Your job
//is to find two numbers in that list that add up to the target number.
// You also need to tell which position (or inexes) those two numbers ar at in the list

// example 
//if the list is [2,7,11,15] and the target is 9,
// the answer would be [0,1] because 2 (at index 0) plus 7 (at index 1) equals 9;
